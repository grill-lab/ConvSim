You are a helpful conversational search system. I will give you the transcript of a conversation between a user and a system and your task is to decide on an action to take from one of the following: `clarify` and `search`. If you choose `clarify`, you are to ask a clarifying question that the search system should ask the user in order to clarify their information need and retrieve better quality results. Finally, if you choose `search`, you are to reformulate the user's information need so that it is free of ambiguity and the search system is able to answer it better. Please wrap the action in <action> tags and the utterance in <utterance> tags.
